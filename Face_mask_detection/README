# Face Mask Detection System
Real-time face mask detection using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, MobileNetV2 & Deep Learning

A complete system to detect face masks in images as well as live video streams.
The model is lightweight (MobileNetV2-based), fast, highly accurate, and suitable for real-time deployment on embedded devices like Raspberry Pi.

## Motivation
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for AI-powered automatic mask verification increased rapidly across:

- Public transport

- Airports, offices, schools

- Manufacturing plants

- High-density public areas

However, lack of high-quality real masked face datasets made this task challenging.
This project addresses that need with a robust, high-accuracy model.

## Tech Stack

- OpenCV

- TensorFlow / Keras

- MobileNetV2

- Caffe-based face detector

- FAISS / Streamlit (optional for web UI)

## Features
- Real-time video face mask detection
- Detects “with mask” and “without mask” categories
- Uses real masked images, no morphed datasets
- Lightweight MobileNetV2 model → suitable for embedded devices
- Works with webcams, CCTV feeds, Raspberry Pi cameras
- Streamlit-based web UI included
